Welcome OniSec's security blog. Here I write about security related topics and provide updates on content creation. I create write-ups on CTF-like challenges, such as Hack The Box, and documenting my methodology in my Gitbook. 

If you're interested in learning and want to connect, feel free to reach out to me via email, Hack The Box forums, Mastodon, or Session (05bc7dc3136c3671817595689a585525dc639139bde600d7c06ea57fd02d5f0426).
