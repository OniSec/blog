Welcome OniSec's security blog. Here I write about security related topics and provide updates on content creation. I create write-ups on CTF-like challenges, such as Hack The Box in my Gitbook. I am also working on documenting my methodology in my Gitbook.

This blog is built on Hugo, hosted by Cloudflare (til I have more reason to migrate to a paid platform such as writefreely). This theme was specifically chosen to avoid Javascript, though I do recognize the irony of hosting with the Crimeflare honeypot. For that reason, TOR is supported, feel free to access this site using TOR.

There is javascript in Gitbook, can't really do anything about that if I want the features that it comes with. To my knowledge, Gitbook is GPL so the javascript should be Stallman approved.
